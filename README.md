# minihack
A programming language for coding using mobile devices

## Introduction
Minihack - lazy working title, subject to revision

I thought it would be interesting to make coding more available on mobile devices like cellphones. There are IDEs for this but I'm not aware of any languages that are optimized for coding on mobile. Accounting for things like restricted keyboard access, limited screen width, etc.

## Progress
Just initial layout is happening right now in [here](initial-doc.md). I plan on slowly moving everything into more structured files and directories.
