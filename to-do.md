# TO-DO

## Tasks
### Soon
* [ ] Get rest of doc in GH, image and anything else
* [ ] Delete initial-doc.md
    * [ ] Organize initial doc sections into separate files
        * [ ] Thoughts might become a journal doc
        * [ ] Actual language pieces (constructs, grammar, functions, etc) would probably become their own directory.

### Later
* [ ] Create process document for making changes to language structure

## Abstract 
*Piece out items here into tasks above*
- Need to list out what all the goals are (currently under Principals). Who are you building this for? Who would you want to use it? What would you want them to do with it? What would you expect them to build?
  - Then, as you build out early alpha versions of the language, start testing it yourself and see if it is useable for intended purposes. Then iterate. Or even pivot if necessary.
